`Extra Points`

Within the `header`, create a `navbar` with links to 2 additional pages. Be sure that the pages correspond to the names given to the links. For example, if the link is labeled "Hobbies", be sure that the page is relevant to the name of the link. It is also important to name the file according to the content of the page. For example `hobbies.html`. Be sure to be consistent in style and color so that the site is cohesive.

TIP: _You can re-use the header and footer in the homepage_
